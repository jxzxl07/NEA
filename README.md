# LAN Networking Application
Encrypta Secure Intranet

Windows Voice Video Text Chat App

A secure desktop application for encrypted messaging and calls, developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science project. Built with Python (PyQt), the platform demonstrates applied concepts in cryptography, networking, and database design.

✨ Features
🔑 Secure Login System – password hashing with salted SHA-256.
📩 Direct Messaging – end-to-end encrypted using RSA.
👥 Group Messaging – encrypted with AES for efficiency.
🎙️ Voice & Video Calling – peer-to-peer communication with encryption.
🗄️ Database – normalised to 3NF with referential integrity.
🖥️ GUI – built in PyQt for an intuitive user interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3
PyQt (GUI framework)
RSA / AES (cryptographic algorithms)
SQLite (database, 3NF)
Sockets (LAN communication)
